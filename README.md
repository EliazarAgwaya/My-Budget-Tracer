#### By **Eliazar Agwaya Magero**
## Description
This application has an interface showing the Income balance, total expense, the balance after deducting the expenses. It also shows the history of the transactions both expenses and income. One can input the name of a transaction and the amount and add it depending on whether it is an expense or income. If it's an income, it gets listed under the income history and if it's an expense it's listed under the expense history. The application automatically updates the balance after an expense or an income has been inputed. The transactions can also be deleted from the history.
